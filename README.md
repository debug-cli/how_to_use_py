***Welcome***
This is a step by step process to using my python scripts thru command prompt with the best stability.

# How to use my python scripts (WINDOWS)

## What do i need?
- [Windows 8.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8ISO) or newer ([Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) or newer reccomended)
- Latest version of Python
- An Internet connection

## How to get python
Download the latest version for Windows [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
Installation on Linux will be different.

## Python installation process
1. Download the installer by clicking "Download Windows installer (64-bit)"
- [Or "Download Windows installer (32 -bit)" if you're on a 32-bit machine.]
3. Launch the installer .exe file
4. Check the box that is next to "Add to PATH
- This is for the terminal commands to work.
4. Click install (top button with shield icon)
5. Wait for it to Install.

## For .py files
1. Download the source code of my repository
- Click the green 'Code' and click Download Zip.
3. **It will come out as a zip file.** Extract the zip file.
4. Put it in a separate folder in Documents or wherever you like.
5. Open that folder in terminal (Right click, Open In Terminal)
6. If the repository that you download had a "requirements.txt" file, execute the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- This is so the packages in the script work properly.
- **This is very important. Not doing this could lead to unusable scripts.**

- When the packages are done installing, now it's time to run the script!
6. Execute the command "python (scriptname).py
7. Use the program!
