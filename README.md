# How to use my python scripts.
## This is a step by step process to using my python scripts thru command prompt with the best stability.

### What needed?
- Windows 10+
- Python 3.11+
- An Internet connection

### How to get python
Download the latest version for Windows [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
## Python installation process
1. Download the installer 
2. Launch the installer
3. Check the box that is next to "Add to PATH
- This is for the terminal commands to work.
4. Click install (top button)
5. Wait for it to Install.

## For .py files
1. Download the source code of my repository
2. Put it in a separate folder in Documents or wherever you like.
3. **It will come out as a zip file.** Extract the zip file.
4. Open that folder in terminal (Right click, Open In Terminal)
5. If the repository that you download had a "requirements.txt" file, execute the command "pip install requirements.txt"
- This is so the packages in the script provide functionality and code properly.
- **This is very important. Not doing this could lead to unusable programs.**
- When the packages are done installing, now it's time to run the program!
6. Execute the command "python (scriptname).py
7. Use the program!
